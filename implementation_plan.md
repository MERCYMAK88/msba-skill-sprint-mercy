# Implementation Plan — Streamlit Dashboard Skill Sprint

## What this repo does
This project demonstrates a simple Streamlit dashboard that turns Python code into an interactive analytics web application.

## What would need to change for a real company
For real company use, the dashboard would need to connect to production databases or APIs, include authentication, and be deployed on a cloud platform rather than run locally.

## Proof of attempt
See run_proof.png for my attempt to run the application locally.
